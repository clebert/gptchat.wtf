> Chat with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo.

The website [gptchat.wtf](https://gptchat.wtf) is an online version of
[Switch LLM](https://github.com/clebert/switch-llm). It exclusively allows chatting with OpenAI GPT
models, without the option to switch to local models. For that functionality, Switch LLM should be
installed and operated locally. However, it offers a quick and effortless way to check if the user
interface meets your preferences.
